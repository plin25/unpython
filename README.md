unpython
========

Take all good coding practices and PENALIZE THEM DURING RUNTIME.

USAGE

unpython your_file.py

The better your coding practices, the more numbers we waste time prime factorizing! The SLOW way. Not the really slow way. Just the normal slow way. It's okay.

What we can remember implementing:

variable/function names must be <3 characters or >20 characters long
==True is highly encouraged
Semicolons are GREAT -- put as many commands on one line as possible
That being said, the longer your lines of code, the better -- you are rewarded for lines >79 characters long
Weirder spacing is better -- surrounding operators with more than one space is rewarded
Inconsistent indentation is rewarded
Try-Excepts and Fors are sinful

TODO:
Make globals encouraged
Imports should be in the middle of the function
Other stuff
