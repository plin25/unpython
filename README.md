unpython
========

Take all good coding practices and PENALIZE THEM DURING RUNTIME.


USAGE

unpython your_file.py


====

The better your coding practices, the more numbers we waste time prime factorizing! The SLOW way. Not the really slow way. Just the normal slow way. It's okay.

What we can remember implementing:

variable/function names must be <3 characters or >20 characters long

`==True` is highly encouraged

Semicolons are GREAT -- put as many commands on one line as possible

That being said, the longer your lines of code, the better -- you are rewarded for lines >79 characters long

Weirder spacing is better -- surrounding operators with more than one space is rewarded

Inconsistent indentation is rewarded

Try-Excepts and Fors are sinful


In conclusion, the better your coding practices, the more time is wasted. In fact, unpython is actually written too well. When run on itself, it prime factors 2380 numbers... then infinite loops because it tries run itself on itself and then itself on itself on itself... and so forth.


TODO:

Make globals encouraged

Imports should be in the middle of the function
